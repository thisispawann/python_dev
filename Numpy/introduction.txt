What is NumPy? [Numerical Python]
- python library for creating
- N-dimensional arrays
- ability to quickly broadcast functions
- built-in linear algenra, statistical distributions, trigonometric, and random number capabilities

Why use NumPy?
- while NumPy structutes look similar to standard python lists, they are much more efficient
- the broadcasting capabilities are also extremely useful for quickly applying functions to our data sets.
